# C_App_Population

This is a basic App to simulate population growth. Every year, some life is lost while some is born. For this one particularly, we get (n/3) birth and (n/4) lost per year.
Given these ratios and by asking the user the starting size of the life (n) and the desired end size, we can find out how many years it will take to reach our goal.
